abstract = {The Active Magnetic Regenerator (AMR) cycle can liquefy cryogens with high efficiency, however the system economics have not been investigated. The computational complexity of AMR modeling tools has limited the parameter space of numerical investigations, and the correlations between the cryocooler and cryogen cost have yet to be resolved. To address these issues, we present a system-level cost optimization of a magnetic liquefier with a Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide (ReBCO) high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet. Using the semi-analytic AMR element model, the capital and operating costs of the cryocooler, superconducting tape and AMR system are optimized in a nested genetic-differential evolution algorithm and explored as a function of the cryocooler temperature. It is shown that a 20 K HTS magnet is several times cheaper than its 70 K counterpart, and in the optimized system, the cost to liquefy natural gas approaches 0.24 {\$}/kg with a 3.57 tonne-per-day capacity and a plant cost of {\$}350,000.},

abstract = {A hybrid cryogenic refrigerator that combines the magnetic refrigeration effect with the GM refrigeration effect has been experimentally studied. ErNi and TmCuAl, which have large magnetocaloric effects, are used to fill the second (low-temperature) stage regenerator of a GM refrigerator and put in a magnetic field varying from 0 to 1.1 T. A phase angle $\alpha$ is defined as the phase between the varying magnetic field and displacer movement and can be tuned in order to find the best timing between the magnetic refrigeration and the GM refrigeration cycle. Efforts have also been made to suppress eddy current losses induced due to the varying magnetic field through the cold head. A phase angle of 60Â° was found to generate best cooling performance through experiments. A minimal no-load temperature of 3.5 K was obtained at 0.5 Hz while the GM refrigeration alone can only generate a no-load temperature of 4.2 K.},

The redesigning process includes choosing the magnetocaloric materials and number of layers and optimizing for particle size, flow, and operation frequency. The simulation consists of the model of the magnetic field, parasitic heat transfer and active regeneration. The model of the magnetic field and parasitic heat transfer are embedded in the 1D model of the active regeneration cycle. The detailed model of the magnetic field, taking the effect of presence of the magnetocaloric materials into account, is described and validated separately against measured magnetic field. An innovative method for including the parasitic heat transfer in the active regeneration model without compromising the accuracy is used. The influence of the properties of the binding agent on the performance of the bonded beds as regenerators are also investigated.},

abstract = {Active magnetic regenerators (AMR) with second order magnetocaloric materials operating below the Curie temperature have a unique property where the magnetized specific heat is lower than the demagnetized specific heat. The associated thermal mass imbalance allows a fraction of heat transfer fluid in the cold heat exchanger to bypass the magnetized regenerator. This cold bypassed fluid can precool a process stream as it returns to the hot side, thereby increasing the efficiency of liquefaction and reducing the cost of liquid cryogens. In the present work, the net cooling power of an active magnetic regenerative liquefier is investigated as a function of the bypass flow fraction. Experiments are performed at a fixed temperature span yielding a 30{\%} improvement in net cooling power, affirming the potential of bypass flow in active magnetic regenerative liquefiers.},

In this work, we describe an active magnetic regenerative refrigerator prototype using a high-field superconducting magnet that produces a 100 K temperature span. Using the experimental data, a semi-analytic AMR element model is validated and enhanced system performance is simulated using liquid propane as a heat transfer fluid. In addition, the regenerator composition and fluid flow are simultaneously optimized using a differential evolution algorithm. Simulation results indicate that a natural gas liquefier with a 160 K temperature span and a second-law efficiency exceeding 20{\%} is achievable.},

However, the goal of building commercially viable magnetic refrigeration systems with high performance and competitive price has not been achieved yet. One of the obstacles to reach this goal is the inadequate properties of the currently existing magnetocaloric materials. In this article, the needed improvements in the properties of the magnetocaloric materials are investigated. Two existing vapor-compression refrigerators are used as reference for the required performance, and magnetic refrigerators are simulated using a numerical model. Apart from the requirements such as uniformity of transition temperature for each layer, small increment in transition temperature in adjacent layers, and mechanical strength of the materials, the study shows that for the investigated cases materials with adiabatic entropy change 2.35 times larger than the existing materials are needed to outperform vapor-compression systems.},

abstract = {A time-dependent, two-dimensional mathematical model of a configuration system for magnetic refrigeration has been developed, based on a reciprocating active magnetic regenerator operating at room temperature. The model's geometry is made of parallel plates of magnetocaloric material separated by microchannels. Through the microchannels, the flow of a heat transfer fluid has also been simulated. Water has been used as heat transfer fluid and as magnetocaloric material we have used the benchmark material gadolinium. The heat transfer inside the regenerator and the fluid flow are modelled separately and the magnetocaloric effect is taken into account by the inclusion of a variable source term in the energy equation. The model simulates the steps of the active magnetic regenerative refrigeration cycle and evaluates the performance in terms of cooling load, COP, temperature span and pressure drop for the parallel-plate configuration. The model has been validated by comparing the numerical results with the results obtained from an experimental device made by a partner. This parametric study allows us to identify the most important characteristics that have a significant influence on the thermal behaviour of the active magnetic regenerator. Several simulation results are discussed and some optimal solutions are presented.},

abstract = {We have investigated numerically the dependence of the temperature span and optimum operating frequency of solid state magnetic refrigerators on the most important physical properties of magnetocaloric materials. We concluded that the temperature span depends inversely on the thermal conductivity of the magnetocaloric material and is proportional to the square root of its density, heat capacity and maximum adiabatic temperature variation upon the application/removal of a magnetic field ($\Delta$Tadm). Also, and contrary to general belief, the increase of the thermal conductivity is not the only factor able to increase the optimum operating frequency. Reducing the density, heat capacity, $\Delta$Tadm or broadening of the $\Delta$Tad{\^{a}}â¬{\v{S}}(T) curve can result in larger operating frequencies. Our results show that a compromise between the maximum achievable temperature span and optimum operating frequency must be reached, as the increase of one reduces the other.},

One modern cooling method that is very efficient and environmentally friendly is based on the magnetocaloric effect. Although numerous prototypes employing this phenomenon have been developed, there is still a need to increase its refrigeration capability and decrease the manufacturing price. The main part in this kind of apparatus is a regenerator bed. Its geometry and the method of filling in with magnetocaloric material impacts the performance of the equipment. The presented paper focuses on the analysis of the influence of the regenerator bed shape on the cooling performance of the system. Six different bed geometries, all with the same amount of gadolinium, were designed, manufactured, and tested on a prototype test stand operating in an AMR cycle. The influence of flow rate and volume of the heat transfer medium on the obtained maximum temperature span was analyzed.},

Limited availability of novel magnetocaloric materials in a suitable form leads to regenerator beds which are smaller than desired. When implemented in a test apparatus, result in unwanted loss mechanisms such as void spaces between the regenerator and heat exchangers. The loss of cooling power due to dead volume losses and thermal interactions with the ambient environment when using small regenerators is investigated with experimental and 1D numerical methods. Due to uncertainty regarding the casing thermal state, a range of cases for casing temperature are numerically tested including: a fixed temperature and a linear temperature profile from hot to cold end using the simulation boundary conditions. Including dead volume sections improves simulation results while casing heat leaks impact simulations with a net cooling power up to 2.5 W.},

There were tested strip samples of M400-50A, M400-65A, M700-50A and M700-65A electrical steel grades cut through water jet technology. The samples' length is equal to 300 mm and their width is set to 30, 15, 10, 7.5 and 5 mm. The magnetic property measurements were performed with a laboratory single strip tester (SST), which can characterize only samples with an area of 300 mm Ã 30 mm. Thus, to reconstruct the standard width of 30 mm, there were put side by side 2, 3, 4 and 6 pieces with the same width. The magnetic quantities were investigated at 1000 mT in the frequency range 10 Ã· 100 Hz. This type of non-conventional cutting method proves to have a low influence on the energy losses with respect to the increase of the cutting perimeter, because during the cutting process the edge damage is limited to a very narrow width.},
