	Abstract = {This work presents the design and performance evaluation of a novel magnetic refrigeration unit capable of controlling the temperature of a 31-bottle wine cooler cabinet. The main components of the system are: an active magnetic regenerator composed of eight porous beds of Gd/Gd-Y spheres, a two-pole magnetic circuit responsible for the magnetic field changes, a set of solenoid valves for flow control, and fan-supplied finned tube heat exchangers on the cold and hot sides of the wine cooler apparatus. Synchronization of the magnetic field variation and fluid flow processes was performed using real-time magnetic field measurements. The system was capable of reaching a mean temperature of 10.8 oC inside the retrofitted wine cooler cabinet by generating 27.9 W of cooling capacity for an ambient temperature of 25 oC. The coefficient of performance and second-law efficiency for this operating point were estimated as 0.21 and 1.0%, respectively. When operating at a cabinet temperature of 12.5 oC, the coefficient of performance and second-law efficiency achieved by the magnetic system were 0.38 and 1.6%.},

@article{bib:Fortkamp2020-ABCM,
	Abstract = {Magnetic cooling is an alternative to vapor compression that does not rely on the use of hazardous substances. The refrigerant is a solid material which reacts to oscillations in magnetic field by changing its temperature (the magnetocaloric effect). In active magnetic regenerators, the magnetocaloric material arranged as a porous medium is subjected to an oscillating fluid flow to allow heat transfer from a cold source to a hot sink in a thermodynamic cooling cycle. Although the literature is abundant with studies on the influence of the fluid flow waveform on magnetic refrigeration devices, the influence of the magnetic field waveform has been much less investigated. In this work, we make use of an active magnetic regenerator numerical model with different mathematically defined waveforms to determine which operating parameters yield the highest values of cooling capacity and coefficient of performance for a specific set of operating conditions. The results show that the best performance is achieved when the magnetic field is kept constant for the same time duration of the fluid flow through the magnetized material, and the transition times between the high and low levels of the magnetic field should be as short as possible.},

The computational complexity of AMR modeling tools has limited the parameter space of numerical investigations, and the correlations between the cryocooler and cryogen cost have yet to be resolved. To address these issues, we present a system-level cost optimization of a magnetic liquefier with a Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide (ReBCO) high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet. Using the semi-analytic AMR element model, the capital and operating costs of the cryocooler, superconducting tape and AMR system are optimized in a nested genetic-differential evolution algorithm and explored as a function of the cryocooler temperature. It is shown that a 20 K HTS magnet is several times cheaper than its 70 K counterpart, and in the optimized system, the cost to liquefy natural gas approaches 0.24 {\$}/kg with a 3.57 tonne-per-day capacity and a plant cost of {\$}350,000.},

ErNi and TmCuAl, which have large magnetocaloric effects, are used to fill the second (low-temperature) stage regenerator of a GM refrigerator and put in a magnetic field varying from 0 to 1.1 T. A phase angle $\alpha$ is defined as the phase between the varying magnetic field and displacer movement and can be tuned in order to find the best timing between the magnetic refrigeration and the GM refrigeration cycle. Efforts have also been made to suppress eddy current losses induced due to the varying magnetic field through the cold head. A phase angle of 60$\,^{\circ}$ was found to generate best cooling performance through experiments. A minimal no-load temperature of 3.5 K was obtained at 0.5 Hz while the GM refrigeration alone can only generate a no-load temperature of 4.2 K.},

The simulation consists of the model of the magnetic field, parasitic heat transfer and active regeneration. The model of the magnetic field and parasitic heat transfer are embedded in the 1D model of the active regeneration cycle. The detailed model of the magnetic field, taking the effect of presence of the magnetocaloric materials into account, is described and validated separately against measured magnetic field. An innovative method for including the parasitic heat transfer in the active regeneration model without compromising the accuracy is used.

The associated thermal mass imbalance allows a fraction of heat transfer fluid in the cold heat exchanger to bypass the magnetized regenerator. This cold bypassed fluid can precool a process stream as it returns to the hot side, thereby increasing the efficiency of liquefaction and reducing the cost of liquid cryogens. In the present work, the net cooling power of an active magnetic regenerative liquefier is investigated as a function of the bypass flow fraction. Experiments are performed at a fixed temperature span yielding a 30{\%} improvement in net cooling power, affirming the potential of bypass flow in active magnetic regenerative liquefiers.},

In this work, we describe an active magnetic regenerative refrigerator prototype using a high-field superconducting magnet that produces a 100 K temperature span. Using the experimental data, a semi-analytic AMR element model is validated and enhanced system performance is simulated using liquid propane as a heat transfer fluid. In addition, the regenerator composition and fluid flow are simultaneously optimized using a differential evolution algorithm.

However, the goal of building commercially viable magnetic refrigeration systems with high performance and competitive price has not been achieved yet. One of the obstacles to reach this goal is the inadequate properties of the currently existing magnetocaloric materials. In this article, the needed improvements in the properties of the magnetocaloric materials are investigated. Two existing vapor-compression refrigerators are used as reference for the required performance, and magnetic refrigerators are simulated using a numerical model. Apart from the requirements such as uniformity of transition temperature for each layer, small increment in transition temperature in adjacent layers, and mechanical strength of the materials, the study shows that for the investigated cases materials with adiabatic entropy change 2.35 times larger than the existing materials are needed to outperform vapor-compression systems.},

	Abstract = {A time-dependent, two-dimensional mathematical model of a configuration system for magnetic refrigeration has been developed, based on a reciprocating active magnetic regenerator operating at room temperature. The model's geometry is made of parallel plates of magnetocaloric material separated by microchannels. Through the microchannels, the flow of a heat transfer fluid has also been simulated. Water has been used as heat transfer fluid and as magnetocaloric material we have used the benchmark material gadolinium. The heat transfer inside the regenerator and the fluid flow are modelled separately and the magnetocaloric effect is taken into account by the inclusion of a variable source term in the energy equation. The model simulates the steps of the active magnetic regenerative refrigeration cycle and evaluates the performance in terms of cooling load, COP, temperature span and pressure drop for the parallel-plate configuration. The model has been validated by comparing the numerical results with the results obtained from an experimental device made by a partner. This parametric study allows us to identify the most important characteristics that have a significant influence on the thermal behaviour of the active magnetic regenerator. Several simulation results are discussed and some optimal solutions are presented.},

We concluded that the temperature span depends inversely on the thermal conductivity of the magnetocaloric material and is proportional to the square root of its density, heat capacity and maximum adiabatic temperature variation upon the application/removal of a magnetic field ($\Delta$Tadm). Also, and contrary to general belief, the increase of the thermal conductivity is not the only factor able to increase the optimum operating frequency. Reducing the density, heat capacity, $\Delta$Tadm or broadening of the $\Delta$Tad{\^{a}}â¬{\v{S}}(T) curve can result in larger operating frequencies. Our results show that a compromise between the maximum achievable temperature span and optimum operating frequency must be reached, as the increase of one reduces the other.},

The main part in this kind of apparatus is a regenerator bed. Its geometry and the method of filling in with magnetocaloric material impacts the performance of the equipment. The presented paper focuses on the analysis of the influence of the regenerator bed shape on the cooling performance of the system. Six different bed geometries, all with the same amount of gadolinium, were designed, manufactured, and tested on a prototype test stand operating in an AMR cycle.

When implemented in a test apparatus, result in unwanted loss mechanisms such as void spaces between the regenerator and heat exchangers. The loss of cooling power due to dead volume losses and thermal interactions with the ambient environment when using small regenerators is investigated with experimental and 1D numerical methods. Due to uncertainty regarding the casing thermal state, a range of cases for casing temperature are numerically tested including: a fixed temperature and a linear temperature profile from hot to cold end using the simulation boundary conditions. Including dead volume sections improves simulation results while casing heat leaks impact simulations with a net cooling power up to 2.5 W.},

The magnetic property measurements were performed with a laboratory single strip tester (SST), which can characterize only samples with an area of 300 mm Ã 30 mm. Thus, to reconstruct the standard width of 30 mm, there were put side by side 2, 3, 4 and 6 pieces with the same width. The magnetic quantities were investigated at 1000 mT in the frequency range 10 Ã· 100 Hz. This type of non-conventional cutting method proves to have a low influence on the energy losses with respect to the increase of the cutting perimeter, because during the cutting process the edge damage is limited to a very narrow width.},

	Abstract = {An expression is determined for the mass of the magnet and magnetocaloric material needed for a magnetic refrigerator and these are determined using numerical modeling for both parallel plate and packed sphere bed regenerators as function of temperature span and cooling power. As magnetocaloric material Gd or a model material with a constant adiabatic temperature change, representing an infinitely linearly graded refrigeration device, is used. For the magnet a maximum figure of merit magnet or a Halbach cylinder is used. For a cost of {\$}40 and {\$}20 per kg for the magnet and magnetocaloric material, respectively, the cheapest 100 W parallel plate refrigerator with a temperature span of 20 K using Gd and a Halbach magnet has 0.8 kg of magnet, 0.3 kg of Gd and a cost of {\$}35. Using the constant material reduces this cost to {\$}25. A packed sphere bed refrigerator with the constant material costs {\$}7. It is also shown that increasing the operation frequency reduces the cost. Finally, the lowest cost is also found as a function of the cost of the magnet and magnetocaloric material. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.},

Central part of the accelerator chain is a superconducting heavy ion synchrotron SIS100, which accelerates injected particles from existing synchrotron SIS18, and provides them to experiment sites and further accelerators. Superconducting magnets in SIS100 are mainly superferric magnet with a Nuclotron cable. After R{\&}D, the First of Series (FoS) main dipole magnet has been manufactured and tested successfully. However, magnetic field quality is unsatisfactory. We report on the investigation of the magnetic field quality by means of magnetic field measurements, geometrical measurements, and electromagnetic simulations.},

The field measurements of the prototypes show very good agreement with the numerical field calculations. The octupole prototype can produce either an anti-symmetric or a symmetric field distribution. Magnets with this novel structure can supply much higher saturation fields, e.g. doubled pole-gap strength of 0.6 T for the dodecapole prototype. The intrinsic field errors for the integrated field distribution are within [Formula presented]1{\%} for a rectangular shape of good field region, which are acceptable for some applications such as beam spot uniformization. Some key technical issues of building the magnets are also discussed. The success of the prototyping will pave the way for applications of the magnet family.},

@article{bib:Bryan2018,
	Abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources.},
